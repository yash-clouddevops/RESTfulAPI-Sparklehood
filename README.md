### `GET /incidents`
- Retrieve all incidents.
- **Response**: `200 OK`
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Example Incident",
    "description": "An example of AI incident.",
    "severity": "High",
    "reported_at": "2025-04-26T12:00:00"
  }
]
```

---

### `POST /incidents`
- Create a new incident.
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "title": "Unexpected AI Behavior",
  "description": "The AI system recommended harmful actions to users.",
  "severity": "High"
}
```
- **Response**: `201 Created`
```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "Unexpected AI Behavior",
  "description": "The AI system recommended harmful actions to users.",
  "severity": "High",
  "reported_at": "2025-04-26T12:30:00"
}
```
- **Note**: Severity must be one of: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`.

---

### `GET /incidents/<id>`
- Retrieve a specific incident by ID.
- **Example**: `GET /incidents/1`
- **Response**: `200 OK`
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Example Incident",
  "description": "An example of AI incident.",
  "severity": "High",
  "reported_at": "2025-04-26T12:00:00"
}
```
- **Error**: `404 Not Found` if incident does not exist.

---

### `DELETE /incidents/<id>`

## üî• Quick Testing (Using cURL)

### Create a New Incident
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/incidents -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "AI Bias Detected", "description": "Detected bias in recruitment AI.", "severity": "Medium"}'
```

### List All Incidents
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/incidents
```

### Get a Specific Incident
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/incidents/1
```

### Delete an Incident
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/incidents/1
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Database file (`data.db`) is created automatically on first run.
- Basic validations are in place (missing fields or invalid severity).
- This project is ideal for learning RESTful APIs with Flask.
